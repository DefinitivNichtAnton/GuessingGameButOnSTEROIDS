The guessing number game is a simple yet challenging game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on whether each guess is too low or too high, and may also provide hints to help the player narrow down their next guess.

In this version of the game, the player can choose to play against the computer. If the player chooses to play against the computer, the game generates a random number and both the player and the computer take turns guessing the number. The game provides feedback on whether each guess is too low or too high. The game ends when either the player or the computer correctly guesses the number or when both run out of attempts.

The game also includes a feature to display hints to help the user narrow down their next guess. The hints include information about whether the number is even or odd and whether the user’s guess is close to the correct number.

The game saves high scores to a file and loads them at the start of each round. When the user correctly guesses the number, their number of attempts is added to a list of high scores and the list is sorted in ascending order. The game displays the high scores at the end of each round.

At the end of each round, the game also displays the history of the player’s guesses. This allows the player to review their previous guesses and improve their strategy for future rounds.
